Sinatra Backed Chat Client
==============================

Sinatra backed chat client program using Ruby and the Ruby gem em-websocket.

To run the program from CL navigate to the program's root folder and input:

```
bundle install
ruby index.rb

```

If the program has started Sinatra will inform you he has
taken the stage:

```
== Sinatra/1.4.4 has taken the stage on 9393 for development with backup from Thin
Thin web server (v1.6.1 codename Death Proof)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 0.0.0.0:9393, CTRL+C to stop
Stopping ...
== Sinatra has ended his set (crowd applauds)
```

While Sinatra says he has "ended" his set, you are actually broadcasting.

In your browser input your local network IP address with port 9393 appended:

```
192.000.000:9393
```

Invite others on your network chat with you! Again use the network address with port 9393.
